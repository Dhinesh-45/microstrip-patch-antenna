# microstrip-patch-antenna
Design and simulation of a Microstripline Rectangular Patch Antenna using CST Studio Suite
> **Note:** The patch and feedline dimensions mentioned here are based on standard design equations for a 2.4 GHz antenna using FR-4 substrate.  
> The actual dimensions used in the CST simulation may slightly differ, as fine-tuning was done during the design process.
